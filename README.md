# 🧪 mixed-language-code

Welcome to my repository of experiments and study projects that combine multiple programming languages! This is a personal playground where I explore how different languages can interoperate—such as C, Assembly, Haskell, Rust, and others. The goal is to deepen my understanding of low-level behavior, performance, and language integration.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder inside this repo is a self-contained experiment or concept. For example:

``` python
windows/experiments/
├── add_two_numbers/
│ ├── add.c # C code calling assembly
│ ├── add.asm # NASM x64 assembly (Windows ABI)
│ ├── add.o # Assembled object file 
│ └── add.exe # Final executable
├── ...
```

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

Some of the things I’m experimenting with:

- 🔗 Calling assembly functions from C
- 🧮 Working with calling conventions
- System V AMD64 ABI (Linux / macOS)
- Microsoft x64 ABI (Windows)
- 🧬 Mixing high-level and low-level code
- 🗂️ Compiling and linking object files manually
- 📜 Platform-specific behavior and optimizations
- ⚙️ Toolchains: nasm, gcc, clang, ld, mingw-w64, etc.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

For most experiments, you’ll need:

for `linux`:

- [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us/) (Netwide Assembler)
- [`gcc`](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (MinGW-w64 for Windows)
- A terminal (e.g., Bash, Zsh)

for `windows`:

- [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us/) (Netwide Assembler)
- [`gcc`](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (MinGW-w64 for Windows)
- A terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mixed-language-code.git
    ```

2. Browse the language-specific directories.
3. Follow instructions in each folder's README to run the examples.
4. `hint`: try add_two_numbers first!
